## Log of my Round or Code Challenge # 1 of #1st_180_days_coding_of_2022 (Periode: First 6 Month or 1st 180 Days of 2022)

Note: Really i'm motivated to continue coding this 2022. I have more than 2 years dedicated to this activitycin my life. I´m happy coding. My objective in this 2022 is to record all my jobs, projects and activities relationed with the art of coding. My final Goal is to convert my self in Developer Full Stack Senior (especially in Python and React) and also in AI and Data Science Engineer (This is my personal goal like Professional Programmer). When i was a young boy (11 - 21 years old) i began to learn programming in MSXBAsic, pascal, C, C++ and Assembly languages. I dedicated Aproximatly 30% of my first part of life to coding. This is one big reason (between several) for i returned back to became in Professional Programmer in this second season of my life (I'm 50 years old). I beleive never is to late for to begin something new or continue or recover an old dream.
